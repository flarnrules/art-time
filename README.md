# Art-Time

Art-Time is an open-source, time-based drawing application. The project is built using Python, PyQt5, and Pillow.

## Description

Art-Time is a simple drawing GUI where the user sets a time (like 10 seconds) and they can pick from a limited selection of drawing tools to make a drawing within the allotted time. Once the timer is up, a timelapse of the drawing is exported as an animated gif and the user can select a folder to save the file. A still frame is also generated of the completed image.

The project is intended to be integrated into an NFT project called "Conscious Stream of Consciousness" in the future.
